#  M-Usage

I needed a solution to quickly check how much data is left on my M-Budget Mobile data plan.

## Notes
* It just logs into the users profile page and grabs the infos from HTML, maybe you can use the code for your own app?
* Today Widget uses the Notifications icon
* Getting the data is a bit slow: logging into migros care portal requires an auth token, and it redirects you twice.

## TODO
- [ ] investigate why the widget sometimes starts with an error message
